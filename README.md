### Controlling Jubilees for Science!

<p align="center"><img src="./docs/images/pipetting.gif" width="800"/></p>

This repository hosts files to build and control a [Jubilee](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Main_Page) for scientific applications. The core of the software is a Python interface for Jubilee to navigate labware installed in the machine. We currently provide assembly instructions, control software, and examples for various tools including OT-2 pipettes, syringes, and cameras. While these tools might cater exactly to your planned use case, they most likely will not! We share these files as a starting point rather than an endpoint: we also provide instructions for developing new tools and associated software for controlling them. We hope you will build new tools for your application and contribute them back to the community for others to use and extend üõ†Ô∏è

## Overview
### Hardware
This repository is designed to be used with the Jubilee platform, outfitted with tools for laboratory automation. Jubilee an open-source & extensible multi-tool motion platform‚Äîif that doesn't mean much to you, you can think of it as a 3D printer that can change its tools. You can read about [Jubilee](https://jubilee3d.com/index.php?title=Main_Page) more generally at the project page. 

### Software
The software here is intended to control Jubilee from Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks to design and run experiments. Check out the examples notebooks for more info.

### Labware and Wetware
The basic functionality supported by this software is intended to be used with a custom deck which accommodates up to 6 standards size microplates.
